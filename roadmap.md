# Project Roadmap

## âœ… Completed

- fetch data, start with daily or 8h klines to remove nuance and abstract generalities
  - get raw data
- clean data
  - clean raw data or handle edge cases
- visualize data, what does the market look like?
  - start with most natural window size, 8h
  - visualize raw data (to ensure cleaning is not obviously off)
  - visualize cleaned data (to develop intuition and understanding and start to be curious about how the market functions)
  - limited analysis (to extend intuition and develop questions to request more data or refine existing data)
  - dialate data to 1d
  - contract data to 1h
  - contract to 1m
  - check out other indices (ETH, sUSDe)
- ask the data questions, be curious about why things might look the way they do
  -consider edges, scenarios, and regimes.
  -consider business case of the business of trading.

- describe the point of the algo
- use words to describe a naive model, explain it to my cat
  - implement model
  - review output (visually and backtest)
  - think about it
- iterate with more granular data
